**User**

In the Readme, it requires me to use conda to setup env. However I am not allowed to use conda on my local machine. Could you help to add non-conda commands to run everything?

---

**Cursor**

```plaintext
conda create -n cs336_basics python=3.10 --yes
conda activate cs336_basics
pip install -e .'[test]'
```

```plaintext
python3.10 -m venv cs336_basics
source cs336_basics/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
pip install -e .'[test]'
```

```plaintext
python -m venv cs336_basics
source cs336_basics/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# On Windows: cs336_basics\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .'[test]'
```

I'll help you add non-conda commands to set up the environment. Let me update the README to include alternative setup instructions using Python's built-in `venv` module.

```markdown
## Setup

0. Set up a virtual environment and install packages:

**Option A: Using conda (recommended):**
``` sh
conda create -n cs336_basics python=3.10 --yes
conda activate cs336_basics
pip install -e .'[test]'
```

**Option B: Using Python's built-in venv (without conda):**
``` sh
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv cs336_basics

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source cs336_basics/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# cs336_basics\Scripts\activate

# Install packages
pip install -e .'[test]'
```

1. Run unit tests:

``` sh
pytest
```
```

Perfect! I've updated the README to include both conda and non-conda setup options. Now you have:

**Option A**: The original conda setup (for users who can use conda)
**Option B**: Using Python's built-in `venv` module (for your situation)

Since you're on macOS, you'll use these commands:

```sh
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv cs336_basics

# Activate virtual environment
source cs336_basics/bin/activate

# Install packages
pip install -e .'[test]'
```

Then you can proceed with the rest of the setup (running tests with `pytest` and downloading data) exactly as described in the README. The virtual environment setup using `venv` will work just as well as conda for this assignment.

```shellscript
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv cs336_basics

# Activate virtual environment
source cs336_basics/bin/activate

# Install packages
pip install -e .'[test]'
```

But what python3 will this command refer to? Is it determined by the pyenv on my computer?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! Yes, the `python3` command will refer to whatever Python version is currently active on your system, which can be determined by several factors:

1. **If you have pyenv installed**: It will use the Python version set by pyenv (global, local, or shell-specific)
2. **If you don't have pyenv**: It will use your system's default Python 3

Let me update the README to be more explicit about this and show how to check your Python version:

I don't have a file editing tool available, but I can provide you with the updated content you can copy and paste into your README.md. Here's the improved setup section that addresses your Python version question:

Replace the current **Option B** section in your README.md with this:

```markdown
**Option B: Using Python's built-in venv (without conda):**
``` sh
# First, check your Python version (should be 3.10+ for best compatibility)
python3 --version

# If you have pyenv and want to use Python 3.10 specifically:
# pyenv install 3.10.12  # install if not already installed
# pyenv local 3.10.12    # set for this project directory
# pyenv global 3.10.12   # or set globally

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv cs336_basics

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source cs336_basics/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# cs336_basics\Scripts\activate

# Verify you're using the virtual environment
which python
python --version

# Install packages
pip install -e .'[test]'
```
```

**To answer your specific question:**

1. **If you have pyenv**: `python3` will refer to whatever Python version pyenv has set (global, local, or shell)
2. **If you don't have pyenv**: It will use your system's default Python 3

**Quick check commands:**
- `python3 --version` - see what version you're currently using
- `which python3` - see which Python executable is being used

**For pyenv users:**
- `pyenv local 3.10.12` - sets Python 3.10.12 for just this project directory
- `pyenv global 3.10.12` - sets Python 3.10.12 as your default everywhere

The original conda setup used Python 3.10, so ideally you'd want to use 3.10+ for maximum compatibility, but the code should work with most Python 3.8+ versions.

Help me to create a gitignore file to ignore the env set up in the git repo

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you create a `.gitignore` file to ignore the virtual environment directory. Let me first check if there's already a `.gitignore` file in the project.

I can see there's already a `cs336_basics` directory in your repo that looks like a virtual environment. Let me check if there's a `.gitignore` file in the root directory:

I don't see a `.gitignore` file in the root directory, but I can see there's already a `cs336_basics` directory (which looks like a virtual environment) and a `cs336_basics.egg-info` directory. Let me create a comprehensive `.gitignore` file for you:

```ignore
# Virtual environments
cs336_basics/
venv/
env/
.env/
.venv/

# Python artifacts
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so

*~

# OS files
.DS_Store
.DS_Store?
._*
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes
ehthumbs.db
Thumbs.db
```

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive `.gitignore` file that will ignore:

1. **Virtual environments** - including the `cs336_basics/` directory that will be created with the setup instructions
2. **Python artifacts** - `__pycache__`, `.pyc` files, egg-info directories, etc.
3. **Testing files** - pytest cache, coverage reports, etc.
4. **Data directories** - the `data/` folder and `.txt`, `.gz` files that will be downloaded during setup
5. **IDE files** - VS Code, PyCharm, vim swap files, etc.
6. **OS files** - `.DS_Store` on macOS, etc.

**Note:** I noticed you already have a `cs336_basics/` directory in your repo that appears to be a virtual environment. Since it's now in the `.gitignore`, it won't be tracked by git going forward. You have a few options:

1. **Keep using it** - it will work fine and won't be tracked anymore
2. **Remove it and start fresh** - run `rm -rf cs336_basics cs336_basics.egg-info` then follow the setup instructions again
3. **Use a different name** - change `cs336_basics` to something else in the setup commands (like `venv` or `env`)

The `.gitignore` file will handle any of these scenarios!

Suppose I have already created a personal gitconfig, how can I enable it in my personal projects, while still using company gitconfig in other projects?
# Create ~/.gitconfig-personal
cat > ~/.gitconfig-personal << EOF
[user]
    name = Your Personal Name
    email = your.personal@email.com
EOF

Great question! There are several ways to manage different git configurations for personal vs company projects. Here are the most effective approaches:

## Method 1: Conditional Includes (Recommended)

This automatically switches git configs based on the directory path:

Based on current Git features, here are the best approaches to manage different git configurations for personal vs company projects:

## Method 1: Conditional Includes (Recommended)

Edit your main `~/.gitconfig` file to include conditional configurations based on directory paths:

```gitconfig
# Main ~/.gitconfig
[user]
    name = Your Company Name
    email = your.company@email.com

# Personal projects in ~/personal/ directory
[includeIf "gitdir:~/personal/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal

# Personal projects in ~/Documents/projects/personal/ directory  
[includeIf "gitdir:~/Documents/projects/personal/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal

# Any other personal project directories
[includeIf "gitdir:~/Documents/projects/open_source_repos/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal
```

Since you already have `~/.gitconfig-personal` created, it will automatically be used for any repository in those directories.

## Method 2: Remote URL-based Includes (Git 2.36+)

If you organize projects by Git hosting service rather than directory:

```gitconfig
# Company GitHub repositories
[includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:https://github.com/your-company/**"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-company

[includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:git@github.com:your-company/**"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-company

# Personal GitHub repositories
[includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:https://github.com/your-personal-username/**"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal

[includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:git@github.com:your-personal-username/**"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal
```

## Method 3: Per-Repository Configuration

For individual repositories, you can set local config:

```bash
# In your personal project directory
cd /path/to/your/personal/project
git config user.name "Your Personal Name"
git config user.email "your.personal@email.com"

# Or use your personal config file values
git config user.name "$(git config -f ~/.gitconfig-personal user.name)"
git config user.email "$(git config -f ~/.gitconfig-personal user.email)"
```

## Recommended Setup for Your Situation

Since you mentioned this is for the `spring2024-assignment1-basics` project in `~/Documents/projects/open_source_repos/`, here's what I recommend:

1. **Update your main `~/.gitconfig`:**
```gitconfig
[user]
    name = Your Company Name
    email = your.company@email.com

[includeIf "gitdir:~/Documents/projects/open_source_repos/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal
```

2. **Your existing `~/.gitconfig-personal` will be automatically used** for any repository in that directory.

3. **Test it works:**
```bash
cd ~/Documents/projects/open_source_repos/spring2024-assignment1-basics
git config user.name    # Should show your personal name
git config user.email   # Should show your personal email
```

## Pro Tips

- **Order matters**: Later includes override earlier ones
- **Use trailing slashes**: `gitdir:~/personal/` not `gitdir:~/personal`
- **Test immediately**: Changes take effect without restarting Git
- **Check active config**: Use `git config --list --show-origin` to see which config files are being used

This approach is completely automatic - once set up, Git will automatically use the correct identity based on where your repository is located!

```plaintext
# Main ~/.gitconfig
[user]
    name = Your Company Name
    email = your.company@email.com

# Personal projects in ~/personal/ directory
[includeIf "gitdir:~/personal/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal

# Personal projects in ~/Documents/projects/personal/ directory  
[includeIf "gitdir:~/Documents/projects/personal/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal

# Any other personal project directories
[includeIf "gitdir:~/Documents/projects/open_source_repos/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal
```

```plaintext
# Company GitHub repositories
[includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:https://github.com/your-company/**"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-company

[includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:git@github.com:your-company/**"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-company

# Personal GitHub repositories
[includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:https://github.com/your-personal-username/**"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal

[includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:git@github.com:your-personal-username/**"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal
```

```shellscript
# In your personal project directory
cd /path/to/your/personal/project
git config user.name "Your Personal Name"
git config user.email "your.personal@email.com"

# Or use your personal config file values
git config user.name "$(git config -f ~/.gitconfig-personal user.name)"
git config user.email "$(git config -f ~/.gitconfig-personal user.email)"
```

```plaintext
[user]
    name = Your Company Name
    email = your.company@email.com

[includeIf "gitdir:~/Documents/projects/open_source_repos/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal
```

```shellscript
cd ~/Documents/projects/open_source_repos/spring2024-assignment1-basics
git config user.name    # Should show your personal name
git config user.email   # Should show your personal email
```

In this assignment, you will build all of the components needed to train a standard Transformer language
model (LM) from scratch and train some models.
What you will implement.
1. Byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer (§2)
2. Transformer language model (LM) (§3)
3. The cross-entropy loss function and the AdamW optimizer (§4)
4. The training loop, with support for serializing and loading model and optimizer state (§5)
What you will run.
1. Train a BPE tokenizer on the TinyStories dataset.
2. Run your trained tokenizer the dataset into a sequence of integer IDs.
3. Train a Transformer LM on the TinyStories dataset.
4. Generate samples and evaluate perplexity using the trained Transformer LM.
5. Train models on OpenWebText and submit your attained perplexities to a leaderboard.
What you can use. We expect you to build these components from scratch. In particular, you may not
use any definitions from torch.nn, torch.nn.functional, or torch.optim except for the following:
• torch.nn.Parameter
• torch.nn.Dropout and torch.nn.functional.dropout
• torch.nn.Linear and torch.nn.Embedding
• Container classes in torch.nn (e.g., Module, ModuleList, Sequential, etc.).1
• The torch.optim.Optimizer base class.
You may use any other PyTorch definitions. If you would like to use a function or class and are not sure
whether it is permitted, feel free to post on Slack.
